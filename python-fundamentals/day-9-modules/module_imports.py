# The basics
# Modules are a large number of built-in functions
# Python comes with a large number of functions that are pre-package as modules
# some of these modules we do not need to import to be able to  use whilst for some, we need to import them
# in order to be able to use them

# we can also create our own modules if we wish to do so...

# This section explores how we can import and use modules in our programs
